## üåê Custom Domain (GoDaddy + Vercel)
- In your Vercel dashboard, go to your project and add your custom domain (e.g., `sujin-lee.com`).
- Vercel will provide DNS records (CNAME or A records) to add to your GoDaddy DNS settings.
- In GoDaddy, update your DNS:
  - **A record:** Point `@` to the Vercel-provided IP (if using A record)
  - **CNAME:** Point `www` to the Vercel-provided CNAME
- Wait for DNS propagation and SSL certificate issuance (Vercel handles SSL automatically).
